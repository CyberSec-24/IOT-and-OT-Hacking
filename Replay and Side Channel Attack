Replay Attack
In a replay attack, attackers intercept legitimate messages from a valid communication and continuously send the intercepted message to the target device to perform a DoS attack or delay it to manipulate the message or crash the target device. 

For example, consider a replay attack that regenerates the signal used to control IoT devices as like a front door. 

The front door uses a lock that is opened using simple infrared signals. 

Essentially, the attacker records the infrared modulation pattern, reproduces the signal, and performs a replay attack on the door to unlock it



Side-Channel Attack
Attackers perform a side-channel attack by extracting information about encryption keys by observing the emission of signals, i.e., “side channels” from IoT devices. 

All devices emit these signals that provide information about the internal computing process, either via power consumption or electromagnetic emanations. 

Attackers carefully observe side-channel emissions to acquire all possible knowledge about varying power consumption so they can access and duplicate the encryption key non-evasively. 

The main advantage of this attack is that it is easy and requires less time to access encryption keys. 

Information leaked from the vulnerable devices helps the attackers to exploit other side-channel techniques, such as performing power-consuming attacks and time-based attacks.
