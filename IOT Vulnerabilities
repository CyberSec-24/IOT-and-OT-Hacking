1. Username Enumeration

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Administrative Interface 
▪ Device Web Interface 
▪ Cloud Interface 
▪ Mobile Application

▪ Ability to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the authentication mechanism


2. Weak Passwords

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Administrative Interface 
▪ Device Web Interface
▪ Cloud Interface 
▪ Mobile Application

▪ Ability to set account passwords to “1234” or “123456”, for example
▪ Usage of pre-programmed default passwords


3. Account Lockout

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Administrative Interface
▪ Device Web Interface 
▪ Cloud Interface 
▪ Mobile Application

▪ Ability to continue sending authentication attempts after 3–5 failed login attempts


4. Unencrypted Services

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Device Network Services 

▪ Network services are not properly encrypted to prevent eavesdropping or tampering by attackers


5. Two-factor Authentication

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Administrative Interface 
▪ Cloud Web Interface 
▪ Mobile Application

▪ Lack of two-factor authentication mechanisms such as a security token or fingerprint scanner


6. Poorly Implemented Encryption

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Device Network Services

▪ Encryption is implemented; however, it is improperly configured or is not being properly updated, e.g., using SSL v2


7. Update Sent Without Encryption

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Update Mechanism

▪ Updates are transmitted over the network without using TLS or encrypting the update file itself


8. Update Location Writable

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Update Mechanism

▪ Storage location for update files is world writable, which can allow firmware to be modified and distributed to all users


9. Denial of Service

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Device Network Services

▪ Service can be attacked in a way that denies service to that service or the entire device


10. Removal of Storage Media

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Device Physical Interfaces

▪ Ability to physically remove the storage media from the device


11. No Manual Update Mechanism

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Update Mechanism 

▪ No ability to manually force an update check for the device


12. Missing Update Mechanism

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Update Mechanism

▪ No ability to update the device


13. Firmware Version Display and/or Last Update Date

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Device Firmware

▪ Current firmware version is not displayed and/or the date of last update is not displayed


14. Firmware and Storage Extraction

Attack Surface:- 
▪ JTAG/SWD Interface 
▪ In-Situ Dumping 
▪ Intercepting an Over-the-Air (OTA) Update
▪ Downloading from the Manufacturer’s Web Page
▪ eMMC Tapping ▪ Unsoldering the SPI Flash/eMMC Chip and Reading It in an Adapter

▪ Firmware contains a lot of useful information, like source code and binaries of running services, preset passwords, and SSH keys


15. Manipulating the Code Execution Flow of the Device

Attack Surface:- 
▪ JTAG/SWD Interface 
▪ Side-Channel Attacks like Glitching

▪ With the help of a JTAG adapter and GNU debugger, we can modify the execution of firmware in the device and bypass almost all software-based security controls
▪ Side-channel attacks can also modify the execution flow or can be used to leak interesting information from the device


16. Obtaining Console Access

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Serial Interfaces (SPI/UART)

▪ By connecting to a serial interface, we can obtain full console access to a device
▪ Usually, security measures include custom bootloaders that prevent the attacker from entering single user mode, but that can also be bypassed


17. Insecure Third-Party Components

Attack Surface:- 
▪ Software

▪ Out-of-date versions of BusyBox, OpenSSL, SSH, web servers, etc
