▪ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE): BLE or Bluetooth Smart is a wireless personal area network. 
This technology is designed to be applied in various sectors such as healthcare, security, entertainment, and fitness.

▪ Light-Fidelity (Li-Fi): Li-Fi is like Wi-Fi with only two differences: 
the mode of communication and the speed. Li-Fi is a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system that uses common household light bulbs for data transfer at a very high speed of 224 Gbps.

▪ Near-Field Communication (NFC):
NFC is a type of short-range communication that uses magnetic field induction to enable communication between two electronic devices. 
It is primarily used in contactless mobile payment, social networking, and the identification of documents or other products.

▪ QR Codes and Barcodes: 
These codes are machine-readable tags that contain information about the product or item to which they are attached. 
A quick response code, or QR code, is a two-dimensional code that stores product information and can be scanned using smartphones, whereas a barcode comes in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) forms of code.

▪ Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID): 
RFID stores data in tags that are read using electromagnetic fields. 
RFID is used in many sectors including industrial, offices, companies, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, livestock, and pets.

▪ Thread:
A thread is an IPv6-based networking protocol for IoT devices. 
Its main purpose is home automation so that the devices can communicate with each other on local wireless networks.

▪ Wi-Fi:
Wi-Fi is a technology that is widely used in wireless local area networking (LAN).
At present, the most common Wi-Fi standard that is used in homes or companies is 802.11n, which offers a maximum speed of 600 Mbps and a range of approximately 50 m

▪ Wi-Fi Direct: 
This is used for peer-to-peer communication without the need for a wireless access point.
Wi-Fi direct devices start communication only after deciding which device will act as an access point.

▪ Z-Wave: 
Z-Wave is a low-power, short-range communication designed primarily for home automation. 
It provides a simple and reliable way to wirelessly monitor and control household devices like HVAC, thermostats, garages, home cinemas, etc.

▪ Zig-Bee: 
This is another short-range communication protocol based on the IEEE 203.15.4 standard. 
Zig-Bee is used in devices that transfer data infrequently at a low rate in a restricted area and within a range of 10–100 m.

▪ ANT: 
Adaptive Network Topology (ANT) is a multicast wireless sensor network technology mainly used for short-range communication between devices related to sports and fitness sensors.


Medium-Range Wireless Communication 

▪ HaLow:
This is another variant of the Wi-Fi standard; it provides an extended range, making it useful for communications in rural areas. 
It offers low data rates, thus reducing the power and cost of transmission.

▪ LTE-Advanced:
LTE-Advanced is a standard for mobile communication that provides enhancement to LTE, focusing on providing higher capacity in terms of data rate, extended range, efficiency, and performance.

▪ 6LoWPAN:
IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) is an Internet protocol used for communication between smaller and low-power devices with limited processing capacity, such as various IoT devices.

▪ QUIC:
Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUICs) are multiplexed connections between IoT devices over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP); they provide security equivalent to SSL/TLS.


Long-Range Wireless Communication

▪ LPWAN:
Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) is a wireless telecommunication network, designed to provide long-range communications between two endpoints.
Available LPWAN protocols and technologies include the following:

o LoRaWAN:
A Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is used to support applications such as mobile, industrial machine-to-machine, and secure two-way communications for IoT devices, smart cities, and healthcare applications.

o Sigfox: 
This is used in devices that have short battery life and need to transfer a limited amount of data.

o Neul:
This is used in a tiny part of the TV white space spectrum to deliver high-quality, high-power, high-coverage, and low-cost networks.

▪ Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT): 
VSAT is a communication protocol that is used for data transfer using small dish antennas for both broadband and narrowband data.

▪ Cellular: 
Cellular is a type of communication protocol that is used for communication over a longer distance.
It is used to send high-quality data but with the drawbacks of being expensive and having high power consumption.

▪ MQTT: 
Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an ISO standard lightweight protocol used to transmit messages for long-range wireless communication. 
It helps in establishing connections to remote locations, for example via satellite links.

▪ NB-IoT: 
Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is a variant of LoRaWAN and Sigfox that uses more enhanced physical layer technology and the spectrum used for machine-to-machine communication.

Wired Communication
▪ Ethernet:
Ethernet is the most commonly used type of network protocol today.
It is a type of LAN (Local Area Network) that consists of a wired connection between computers in a small building, office, or campus.

▪ Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA): 
MoCA is a type of network protocol that provides high-definition videos and related content to homes over existing coaxial cables.

▪ Power-Line Communication (PLC): 
This is a type of protocol that uses electrical wires to transmit power and data from one endpoint to another. 
PLC is required for applications in different areas such as home automation, industrial devices, and broadband over power lines (BPL)
