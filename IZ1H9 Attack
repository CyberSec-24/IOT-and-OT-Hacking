IZ1H9 is a Mirai-based botnet malware discovered in early 2021 and will continue to spread until 2023.

Botnet malware has proliferated owing to the exploitation of various vulnerabilities in IoT networks. 

Once a vulnerable device has been identified and infected, IZ1H9 adds the infected device to the botnet fleet. 

The malware compromises and hijacks the computational resources of the vulnerable devices, using them for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

IZ1H9 uses a sophisticated shell script downloader to bypass security solutions, hide their presence, and establish a persistent connection with a command-and-control (C2) server.

IZ1H9 Attack Scenario: 
▪ Step 1: Pre-exploitation Attackers identify and select targets running the Linux operating systems.
They then search for weakly configured devices and exploit vulnerabilities in the exposed servers and networking devices in the IoT environment.
Attackers attempt to scan and exploit devices containing the following vulnerabilities: o Tenda G103 command injection vulnerability 

o LB-Link command injection vulnerability 
o DCN DCBI-Netlog-LAB remote code execution vulnerability 
o Zyxel remote code execution vulnerability


▪ Step 2: Exploitation Attackers attempt to download and execute a shellscript downloader (lb.sh) from IP 163.123.143[.]126 on the vulnerable devices. 
The shell script downloader deletes logs to hide its tracks and downloads bot clients for different Linux architectures, such as

o hxxp://163.123.143[.]126/bins/dark.x86 
o hxxp://163.123.143[.]126/bins/dark.mips 
o hxxp://163.123.143[.]126/bins/dark.mpsl 
o hxxp://163.123.143[.]126/bins/dark.arm4 

Both clients are downloaded from URLs, such as hxxp://2.56.59[.]215/i.sh and hxxp://212.192.241[.]72/lolol.sh, to contact a C2 domain dotheneedfull[.]club, and they resolve it to 212.192.241.72.

The botnet client ensures that only a single execution instance exists.
If a botnet process already exists on the device, the botnet client overwrites the current process and starts a new process

The IZ1H9 variant decrypts its configuration strings using an XOR decryption with the key 0xBAADF00D

The IZ1H9 variant then spread through the HTTP, SSH, and Telnet channels.
For SSH and Telnet, the variant spreads through brute-force attacks using a list of nearly 100 weak username and password combinations
