BlueBorne Attack Using HackRF One

IoT devices involve wireless communication using RF, ZigBee, or LoRa.

Attackers use HackRF One to perform attacks such as BlueBorne or AirBorne attacks, including replay, fuzzing, and jamming. 

HackRF One is an advanced hardware-and software-defined radio with a range of 1 MHz to 6 GHz. 

It transmits and receives radio waves in half-duplex mode, so it is easy for attackers to perform attacks using this device.

It can sniff a wide range of wireless protocols from GSM to Z-wave.


Replay Attack using HackRF One Attackers perform replay attacks on target IoT devices using tools such as HackRF One. 

To perform this attack, attackers need to discover the radio frequency of the target device. 

Attackers use online resources such as the FCC database to determine the frequency of the target device. 

Alternatively, attackers also use tools such as RTL-SDR to determine the frequency of a target device in the vicinity. 

Once the frequency is obtained, attackers use tools such as HackRF One to launch a replay attack.


Steps to perform a replay attack on the target IoT device:
▪ Step 1: Record the device’s signal using the following command: hackrf_transfer -r connector.raw -f [device frequency] 
Here, -r → used to record the signal, -f → frequency of the device

Step 2: Replay the signal to the target using the following command: hackrf_transfer -t connector.raw -f [device frequency] 
Here, -t → used to replay the signal
