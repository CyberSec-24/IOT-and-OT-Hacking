Once the attackers gather information about a target OT network and systems, they perform vulnerability scanning to identify available exploits and vulnerabilities in the critical infrastructure and OT.

Attackers use tools such as SCADA Family for Nessus and Skybox Vulnerability Control to detect vulnerabilities in OT and IT devices, protocols, and applications, including ICS/SCADA, PLCs, RTUs, HMIs, gateways, desktop computers, and other networked systems. 

Attackers also use tools such as Wireshark to identify vulnerabilities via monitoring and analysis of industrial network traffic. 


Vulnerability Scanning Using Nessus

Nessus is a vulnerability assessment tool that allows attackers to find vulnerabilities in ICS and SCADA systems.

This tool also provides attackers with a quick view of vulnerabilities associated with default policies and templates, and then allows them to create their own policies.

Attackers use Nessus to discover and group all the vulnerabilities to launch various attacks on target OT networks. 

Nessus includes a bunch of SCADA plugins through which attackers can perform vulnerability scanning on target ICS/SCADA devices.

The vulnerabilities are obtained based on the plugin signatures



Vulnerability Scanning using Skybox Vulnerability Control

Skybox conducts detailed path analysis across combined OT and IT networks and provides insight into associated vulnerabilities and related attack vectors. 

Skybox can combine SCADA and ICS data with the information gathered from attack vector analysis, Skybox intelligence feed, SIEMs, threat intelligence feeds, etc.

This tool can prioritize millions of vulnerabilities in OT/IT networks based on their risks. 

Attackers can analyze and group all the vulnerabilities across the networks using Skybox to launch various attacks on the IT/OT environment


Sniffing and Vulnerability-Scanning Tools

SmartRF Packet Sniffer includes software and firmware to capture and display over-the-air packets. 

The capture device is connected to the PC via USB. 

SmartRF Packet Sniffer supports the CC13xx and CC26xx family of devices as a capture device; furthermore, it uses Wireshark for packet display and filtering.

It supports protocols such as ZigBee, EasyLink, and BLE


Vulnerability Scanning Tool: Microsoft Defender for IoT

The Microsoft Defender for IoT platform performs a vulnerability assessment on an IoT and ICS environment and returns an objective risk score.

It identifies all IoT and ICS assets connected to the target network. 

It enumerates device-level vulnerabilities such as missing patches, weak passwords, unused open ports, remote access ports, etc.

It generates reports on network-level vulnerabilities such as unauthorized Internet connections, weak firewall rules, rogue subnet connections between IT, IoT, and ICS, unauthorized Wireless Access Points (WAPs), and rogue devices.


Fuzzowski 
Fuzzowski is a network protocol fuzzer that helps attackers perform fuzz tests on ICS protocols. 

It assists attackers throughout the process of fuzzing a network protocol, as well as configuring communications.

Attackers must first gain a thorough understanding of the protocol that they aim to fuzz

Fuzzing the BACnet protocol:
python -m fuzzowski 127.0.0.1 47808 -p udp -f bacnet -rt 0.5 -m BACnetMon

Fuzzing Modbus:
python -m fuzzowski 127.0.0.1 502 -p tcp -f modbus -rt 1 -m modbusMon

Fuzzing IPP:
python -m fuzzowski printer1 631 -f ipp -r get_printer_attribs --restart smartplug
