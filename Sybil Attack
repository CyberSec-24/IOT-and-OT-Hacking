Vehicular communications play an important role in safe transportation by exchanging important safety messages and traffic updates, but even vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are not safe from the attackers’ reach. 

An attacker uses multiple forged identities to create a strong illusion of traffic congestion, affecting communication between neighboring nodes and networks. 

Sybil attacks in VANETs, which have a great impact on a network’s performance, are regarded as the most serious attacks. 

This type of attack impairs the potential applications in VANETs by creating a strong illusion of traffic congestion.

To perform this type of attack, a vehicle is declared to be present in different locations at the same time

For example, let a node that spoofs itself as other nodes and launches an attack be called Sybil node “X.” 

It is created by forming a new identity or stealing an existing legal identity. In proper communication, the other nodes “A” and “B” should only communicate with each other.

However, in this scenario, node “X” intervenes as a known internal node and attacks the network. 

Node “X” tries to communicate with the normal neighboring nodes (“A” and “B”) using multiple forged identities. 

Thus, it creates significant chaos and security risks in the network
