Scanning ICS/SCADA Systems using Nmap

▪ Identifying Open Ports and Services

nmap -Pn -sT --scan-delay 1s --max-parallelism 1 -p 80, 102, 443, 502, 530, 593, 789, 1089-1091, 1911, 1962, 2222, 2404, 4000, 4840, 4843, 4911, 9600, 19999, 20000, 20547, 34962-34964, 34980, 44818, 46823, 46824, 55000-55003 <Target IP>

Attackers use the above Nmap command to perform initial reconnaissance to identify active ICS/SCADA protocols. The port numbers listed in the command are well-known port numbers used for ICS/SCADA protocols


▪ Identifying HMI Systems 
nmap -Pn -sT -p 46824 <Target IP> Some vendors provide HMI interfaces that operate on ports other than ICS/SCADA ports.
For example, consider the HMI software Sielco Sistemi Winlog, which uses TCP port 46824


 Scanning Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLCs
nmap -Pn -sT -p 102 –script=s7-info <Target IP> Attackers use the above command to detect PLC devices with open port 102. 
Siemens SIMATIC S7 PLC devices use port 102 for S7 Communication, used for exchanging information between PLC devices and SCADA systems


Scanning Modbus Devices 
nmap -Pn -sT -p 502 --script modbus-discover <Target IP>
nmap -sT -Pn -p 502 --script modbus-discover --script-args='modbus-discover.aggressive=true' <Target IP>

Attackers use the above command to identify Modbus-enabled devices along with their Slave IDs


 Scanning BACnet Devices 
nmap -Pn -sU -p 47808 --script bacnet-info <Target IP> 

Attackers enumerate BACnet devices used for interconnecting and controlling building and automation systems, HVAC systems, etc. 

The above command helps attackers to retrieve information such as the name of the vendor, device name, serial number, and firmware version.

It also helps attackers to detect BACnet Broadcast Management Devices (BBMDs) using NSE script BACnet-discover-enumerate.nse.


Scanning Ethernet/IP Devices
nmap -Pn -sU -p 44818 --script enip-info <Target IP>

Ethernet/IP is a popular protocol implemented by many industrial networks. 
Ethernet/IP uses Ethernet as a transport layer protocol, and CIP is used to provide services for industrial applications. This protocol operates on UDP port number 44818.
Using the above command, attackers can gather information such as the name of the vendor, product code and name, device name, IP address, etc.


Scanning Niagara Fox Devices
nmap -Pn -sT -p 1911,4911 --script fox-info <Target IP>

Niagara Fox is a protocol used for device-to-device within building management systems (BMSs). This protocol operates on TCP ports 1911 and 4911. 
The above command allows attackers to gather information such as application name, Java version, host OS, time zone, local IP address, and software versions.


Scanning ProConOS Devices 
nmap -Pn -sT -p 20547 --script proconos-info <Target IP> 

ProConOS is a high-performance runtime engine for PLC devices designed to control embedded and PC-based control applications.
Attackers can use the above command to enumerate information such as PLC type, project name, project source code name, and ladder logic runtime information.


 Scanning Omron PLC Devices 
nmap -Pn -sT -p 9600 --script omron-info <Target IP> 
nmap -Pn -sU -p 9600 --script omron-info <Target IP> 

Factory Interface Network Service (FINS) is an Omron protocol used by PLC programs to communicate program data and perform other services with a remote PLC device. 
FINS uses TCP or UDP port 9600 to provide services


Scanning PCWorx Devices 
nmap -Pn -sT -p 1962 --script pcworx-info <Target IP>
PCWorx are PC-based automated solutions for industrial networks. 
These systems process unauthenticated messages from remote systems. Attackers use the above command to gather information such as PLC type, model number, and firmware version



Sniffing using NetworkMiner

NetworkMiner helps attackers to perform passive network sniffing and packet capturing to detect open ports, hostnames, operating systems, sessions, etc. 

without generating traffic on the network. 

Attackers also use NetworkMiner for parsing and analyzing PCAP files and reassembling/recreating transmitted files or certificates from the PCAP files. 

Using NetworkMiner, attackers can gain access to the PCAP files that can be used to analyze the earlier captured network traffic from the ICS network.


Analyzing Modbus/TCP Traffic using Wireshark 
Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer tool that can be used for capturing and analyzing network traffic. 

Attackers use this tool to capture and analyze Modbus/TCP traffic on industrial networks. 

Attackers manipulate the captured packets and send a malicious payload to the Modbus device.

Modbus/TCP does not have any in-built encryption or security features, so attackers can easily gather information from the data packets being transmitted between the network and a Modbus port on a device.
