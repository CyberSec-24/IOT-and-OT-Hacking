▪ Most smart vehicles use smart locking systems that involve the transmission of an RF signal in the form of a code from a modern key fob, which locks or unlocks the vehicle, to the receiver in the vehicle

▪ This code that locks or unlocks a vehicle or garage is called a Rolling Code or Hopping Code. The attacker uses a jammer to thwart the transmission of a code

▪ After obtaining the code, the attacker can use it to unlock and steal the vehicle

Most smart vehicles use smart locking systems, which include an RF signal transmitted in the form of code from a modern key fob to lock or unlock the vehicle. 

Here, the code sent to the vehicle is only used once and is different for every other use, which means if a vehicle receives the same code again, it rejects it.
  
The code that locks or unlocks a car or garage is called a rolling code or hopping code. 

It is used in a keyless entry system to prevent replay attacks. An eavesdropper can capture the code transmitted and later use it to unlock the garage or vehicle. 

To obtain the rolling code, the attacker thwarts the transmission of a signal from the key fob to the receiver in the vehicle. 
  
This attack is performed using a jamming device that simultaneously jams the signal and sniffs the code, and the attacker later uses that code to unlock the vehicle or the garage door

▪ Victim presses car remote button and tries to unlock the car 

▪ Attacker uses a jammer that jams the car’s reception of the rolling code sent by the victim and simultaneously sniffs the first code

▪ The car does not unlock; victim tries again by sending a second code ▪ Attacker sniffs the second code 

▪ On the second attempt by the victim, the attacker forwards the first code, which unlocks the car

▪ The recorded second code is used later by the attacker to unlock and steal the vehicle
