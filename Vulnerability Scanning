SCanning using IotSeeker
Once the attackers gather information about a target device, they search for the attack surfaces of a device (identify the vulnerabilities) that they can attack. 

Vulnerability scanning allows an attacker to find the total number of vulnerabilities present in the firmware, infrastructure, and system components of an IoT device that are accessible.

After identifying the attack surface area, the attacker will scan for vulnerabilities in that area to identify an attack vector and perform further exploitation on the device


Vulnerability Scanning using IoTSeeker Attackers use tools such as IoTSeeker to discover IoT devices that are using default credentials and are vulnerable to various hijacking attacks.

IoTSeeker will scan a network for specific types of IoT devices to detect whether they are using the default, factory-set credentials. 

The recent Internet outage has been attributed to use of IoT devices (CCTV cameras, DVRs, and others) with default credentials. 

This tool helps organizations scan their networks to detect these types of IoT devices, and to identify whether credentials have been changed or whether the device is still using the factory setting.

IoTSeeker focuses on HTTP/HTTPS services

For example, attackers run the following command to find devices with default credentials: perl iotScanner.pl <IP address/range of IP’s>


Vulnerability Scanning using Genzai 
Genzai is an IoT security toolkit that allows attackers to detect and scan IoT dashboards, including wireless routers, surveillance cameras, and human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for default passwords and vulnerabilities based on paths and versions. 

This tool fingerprints an IoT product running on a target by analyzing the HTTP responses received using a set of signatures and templates.

It then scans for vendor-specific default passwords such as 'admin:admin' and other potential vulnerabilities. 

Attackers can run the following command to scan a target IoT device’s dashboard and save the output in .json format: ./genzai <target_host> -save scan.json


Vulnerability Scanning using Nmap
Attackers use vulnerability-scanning tools such as Nmap to identify the IoT devices connected to the network along with their open ports and services. 

Nmap generates raw IP packets in different ways to identify live hosts or devices on the network, services offered by them, their operating systems, type of packet filters used, etc. 

Attackers can also use Angry IP Scanner tool for this purpose.

Attackers use the following Nmap command to scan a specific IP address: nmap -n -Pn -sS -pT:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP> 
To perform a complete scan of the IoT device that checks for both TCP and UDP services and ports: nmap -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP>
To identify the IPv6 capabilities of a device: nmap -6 -n -Pn -sSU -pT:0-65535,U:0-65535 -v -A -oX <Name><IP>


beSTORM
beSTORM is a smart fuzzer that detects buffer overflow vulnerabilities by automating and documenting the process of delivering corrupted inputs and watching for an unexpected response from the application.

By applying automated protocol-based fuzzing techniques, beSTORM acts as an automated black-box auditing tool.

It tries virtually every attack combination intelligently, starting with the most likely scenarios, and detects application anomalies, which indicate a successful attack.

It discovers code weaknesses and certifies the security strength of any product without access to source code. 

It tests any protocol or hardware, even those used in IoT, process control, automotive, and aerospace
