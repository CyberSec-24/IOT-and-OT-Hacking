Hardware-based attack Attackers use hardware tools such as RTL-SDR to perform SDR-based attacks on IoT devices. 

o RTL-SDR 

RTL-SDR hardware is available in the form of a USB dongle that can be used to capture active radio signals in the vicinity (an Internet connection is not mandatory). 

It is available in different models, such as DVB-T SDR, RTL2832, RTL dongle, or DVB-T dongle. 

The RTL-STR tool can capture frequencies ranging from 500 kHz up to 1.75 GHz based on the selected SDR models.

Attackers use an RTL-SDR radio scanner to perform the following activities: 
• Receiving and decoding GPS signals 
• Analyzing spectrum 
• Listening to DAB broadcast radio 
•Listening to and decoding HD radio 
• Sniffing GSM signals


 Software-based attack
Along with hardware tools, attackers can also assault SDR-based IoT devices using various software tools, such as GNU Radio

GNU Radio 

The GNU Radio tool makes use of external RF hardware to generate SDR. 

It offers a framework and the required tools to generate software radio signals. 

It also offers processing units for signals to implement software radios. 

Attackers use GNU Radio to perform various SDR-based attacks on target IoT devices. 

Before attacking the target device, attackers need to build and configure GNU Radio. 

After the successful installation of GNU Radio, attackers use the tools below to perform further exploitation.

GNU Radio consists of a number of pre-defined programs and tools, which can be used for a variety of tasks. 
• uhd_ft → A spectrum analyzer tool that can be connected to a UHD device to find the spectrum at a given frequency
• uhd_rx_cfile → Stores wave samples with the help of a UHD device; samples can be stored in a file and analyzed later using GNU Radio or similar tools such as Matlab or Octave
• uhd_rx_nogui → Used to obtain and listen to the incoming signals on the audio device
• uhd_siggen_gui → Used to create simple signals such as sine, square, or noise
• gr_plot → Used to present previously recorded samples saved in a file
