▪ Run Nmap to identify IoT devices using insecure HTTP ports for transmitting data: nmap -p 80,81,8080,8081 <Target IP address range>

▪ Now, set up your wireless card in monitor mode and identify the channel used by the target router for broadcasting. 
For this, run ifconfig to identify your wireless card, here: wlan0

▪ Run airmon-ng to put the wireless card in monitor mode: airmon-ng start wlan0

▪ Next, run Airodump-ng to scan all the nearby wireless networks: airodump-ng start wlan0mon

▪ Now, discover the target wireless network and note down the corresponding channel to sniff the traffic using Wireshark

▪ Next, set up your wireless card to listen to the traffic on the same channel.
For example, if the target network’s channel is 11, run airmon-ng to set your wireless card listening on channel 11: airmon-ng start wlan0mon 11

▪ Launch Wireshark and double-click the interface that was kept in monitor mode, here wlan0mon, and start capturing the traffic
