▪ A BlueBorne attack is performed on Bluetooth connections to gain access and take full control of the target device
▪ It is a collection of various techniques based on the known vulnerabilities of the Bluetooth protocol
▪ BlueBorne is compatible with all software versions and does not require any user interaction, precondition, or configuration, except that the Bluetooth should be activated
▪ After gaining access to a device, the attacker can penetrate any corporate network using that device to steal critical information about the organization and spread malware to nearby devices

A BlueBorne attack is performed on Bluetooth connections to gain access to and take full control of the target device. 

Attackers connect to nearby devices and exploit the vulnerabilities of the Bluetooth protocol to compromise the devices. 

BlueBorne is a collection of various techniques based on the known vulnerabilities of the Bluetooth protocol. 

This attack can be performed on multiple IoT devices, including those running operating systems such as Android, Linux, Windows, and older versions of iOS. 

In all operating systems, the Bluetooth process has high privileges. 

After gaining access to one device, an attacker can penetrate any corporate network using that device to steal critical information from the organization and spread malware to nearby devices.

BlueBorne is compatible with all software versions and does not require any user interaction, precondition, or configuration except for Bluetooth being active. 

This attack establishes a connection with the target Bluetooth-enabled device without even pairing with the device. 

Using this attack, an attacker can discover Bluetooth-enabled devices, even though they are not in an active discovery mode.

Once the attacker identifies any nearby device, he/she tries to extract the MAC address and OS information to perform further exploitation on the target OS.

Based on the vulnerabilities present in the Bluetooth protocol, attackers can even perform remote code execution and man-in-the-middle attacks on the target device

▪ Attacker discovers active Bluetooth-enabled devices around him/her; all Bluetooth-enabled devices can be located even if they are not in discoverable mod

▪ After locating any nearby device, the attacker obtains the MAC address of the device

▪ Now, the attacker sends continuous probes to the target device to determine the OS 

▪ After identifying the OS, the attacker exploits the vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth protocol to gain access to the target device

▪ Now the attacker can perform remote code execution or a man-in-the-middle attack and take full control of the device
