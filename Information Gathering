CIRT.net’s default password database is an online database that stores default passwords for various devices, including those used in critical infrastructures.

Attackers can use this database to obtain various default passwords for a wide range of devices such as routers, switches, industrial control systems (ICS), and more.


 Kamerka-GUI
Kamerka-GUI is an OT reconnaissance tool designed to locate and map Internet-facing industrial control systems (ICS). 

The tool utilizes Shodan’s advanced search filters to identify specific ICS devices such as SCADA systems, PLCs, HMIs, and RTUs. 

Attackers can identify country-specific vulnerable ICS devices using the Kamerka-GUI. 

The tool also displays the locations of the identified ICS devices on an interactive map, offering a clear visual representation of their distribution.

They can also generate heat maps to highlight the regions with high concentrations of vulnerable devices.
