Gqrx is an SDR implemented with the help of the GNU Radio and Qt GUI tool. 

Attackers use hardware devices such as FunCube dongle, Airspy, HackRF, RTL-SDR and USRP devices along with Gqrx SDR, to analyze the spectrum. 

Attackers use Gqrx to observe the frequency bands of temperature/humidity sensors, light switches, car keys, M-bus transmitters, etc. 

Gqrx can also enable an attacker to listen to or eavesdrop on radio FM frequencies or any radio conversations

Steps to analyze the spectrum using Gqrx: 

▪ The Gqrx and GNU Radio packages consist of all the Gqrx utilities. 
Run the following commands to download and install this package from GitHub: 
git clone https://github.com/gqrx-sdr/gqrx.git gqrx.git 
cd gqrx.git 
mkdir build 
cd build cmake .. make 
Attackers use hardware tools such as FunCube Dongle Pro+, which connects it to a USB port on a PC to analyze various frequency bands.

▪ Launch Gqrx using the following command: gqrx
▪ The Gqrx central window displays frequencies, and their noises can be heard via headphones or speakers


Analyzing IoT Traffic using ONEKEY
Attackers use tools such as ONEKEY to discover target IoT devices and analyze their network traffic to identify vulnerabilities. 

IoT Inspector helps the attacker to breach privacy and security mechanisms. 

This tool projects vulnerabilities in the form of tables and graphs. 

It also allows the attacker to record and replay all information from the communicating devices to gather sensitive information.

ONEKEY automatically scans and displays the available devices in the network.

Selecting the target device can display the network activities and communication endpoints of that device.

Upon clicking “network activities,” it displays a live chart of the traffic the device is accessing, and the communication endpoints will display the services the IoT device has received
